# Study Mode better Discord Plugin
Uses https://github.com/rauenzi/BDPluginLibrary, and intended for a specific server

## Building
Install dependencies and build both the library, and the plugin:
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run build_plugin_packed
```
This will install everything, and also place the plugins in your betterdiscord plugin directory (assuming it is the default)

To edit the plugin, go to `./plugins/StudyMode`. All the other files are related to `BDPluginLibrary`.
